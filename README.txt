# auction

Streamlabs Chatbot script to run auctions using your Streamlabs currency.

Contribute to the script at https://github.com/aseroff/auction/

Future Features: more string customization, ensure users have enough currency, include currency name.

v 0.0.1: Initial release:

Users with mod and higher permissions can start an auction with `!auction [thing to be auctioned]`.
Chatters can type `!bid [value]` to bid on the auction. When there's a winner, the winning bid is withdrawn from their currency.
